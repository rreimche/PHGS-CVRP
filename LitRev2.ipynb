            "The paper \"ChatDev: Communicative Agents for Software Development\" proposes a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) as specialized agents to develop comprehensive solutions through multi-agent cooperation in software development phases, including design, coding, and testing. The framework uses a chat chain to divide tasks and guide agents in communication and solution proposition. It employs \"communicative dehallucination\" to reduce coding hallucinations and ensures context awareness through memory segmentation. The authors demonstrate the superiority of ChatDev over baseline methods in terms of completeness, executability, consistency, and overall quality. The study highlights the importance of multi-agent cooperation in software development and provides insights for enhancing the autonomy of LLM agents.\n",
